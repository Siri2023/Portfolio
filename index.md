## Current Project: World Energy Consumption

As someone interested in Enviromental awareness i chose this dataset to analyse since it showcases the growth of renewable energy sources over the dacades. from an economical aspect this Energy Transition is on its way to decarbonize and decentralize the energy value chain.

# UK Traffic Casuaties Analysis 
The United Kingdom has a well-established road network, with millions of vehicles travelling on its roads every day. Unfortunately, this high volume of traffic also results in a significant number of road traffic accidents, injuries and fatalities. Traffic casualties are a major concern in the UK, and statistics show that thousands of people are injured or killed in road accidents each year.
This report was created to highlight the risks associated with certain driving behaviors, road types, and road conditions, and to promote safe and responsible driving practices among the general public.
